# `character-txtr` — CHARACTER TXTR

[Character](../character/README.md) with a texture stage: fold → **texture** →
saturate → tilt → compress → width → mix. The source is `character.asm` as
of `0ab4e46c` with the TXTR block (`chtx2`, its per-block decode and its
P tables); everything else, knobs included, is Character's. On DJ EQ's id
`0x0d` (Character keeps LO-FI's `0x1c`; the registry allows one module per
id), drawn CHRT / CharTxtr:
[`remixes/test/character-txtr`](../../remixes/test/character-txtr/README.md)
is bottleservice with this station in Character's place.

Why a separate module: TXTR costs 163 of the station's 403 cycles per sample
and four of them beside the reverb price a core at 2,751 against the 3,120
usable (the pricer reads the reverb ~270 low, so ~3,020; the measured die
point is 3,119, the design ceiling 3,000). No hardware has run that load.
bottleservice keeps the plain station (244) until a unit has.

## The knob

| page | slot | name | range | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 9 | TXTR | 0–127, default 0 | Airwindows Pockey2 after FOLD: mu-law encode, quantise to 2^(16 − 12·k/128) steps (16 → 4.1 bits), decode, a hold of floor((k/128)³·32) samples (0 → 31) on one countdown for both channels, and Pockey2's blur (out = held·blur + previous held·(1 − blur), blur = 0.618 − \|coded − previous dry\| floored at 0). One knob drives both of Pockey2's sliders (A = k/128, B = 1 − k/128), wet = 1. 0 skips the stage, bit-exact |

## Measured

- Against `pockey2_ref.py` (a float transcription of `Pockey2Proc.cpp`):
  mean |err| 0.00003–0.0034 at TXTR 8/43/64/100/127 and 0.25/0.8 FS, level
  within 0.03 dB, L == R; TXTR 0 bit-exact (`verify_character_txtr.py`).
- Cost (pricer `cycle_count.py`): 403 cycles per sample in INFL (TAPE 399,
  TUBE 366); TXTR 163 of it: two `chtx2` calls (the codec by two 257-point
  tables, interpolated; the quantiser's two multiplies and a mask; the hold
  and blur) and the shared countdown. 1,093 words per payload; its tables
  are 546 P words, parked in the stock curve bank by the build. Pockey
  (the first version, 13–22 Sep 2026 in Character) priced 277.
- Not on hardware. 22 Sep 2026's squeal on the master, which removed the
  first TXTR, was never reproduced on the harness and is not addressed here.

## Gates

`verify_character_txtr.py` and `verify_charkey_txtr.py` (the manifest's:
Character's two gates run on this module), `verify_dirtystate`, and the
test remix's `make check`.

## Sources

| stage | source | the law |
|---|---|---|
| TXTR | Airwindows Pockey2 (Chris Johnson, MIT, 2022; `Pockey2Proc.cpp`) | mu-law encode, `floor(y·R)/R` toward zero with `R = (int)2^(4+12B)`, mu-law decode, a hold of `floor(A³·32)` samples, blur `0.618 − \|x − lastDry\|` ≥ 0 between the held sample and the previous one. Here the codec is two 257-point tables interpolated, R is built per block from a 32-word mantissa table, and `pockey2_ref.py` is the transcription the gate measures against |

The other stages are Character's (its README, Sources). Licences in
`THIRD_PARTY.md`.
