"""DIRECT_JUMP_KYOTI -- an immediate pattern change, toggled with [PTN] + [YES] (OFF at every power-on): a cued pattern takes over on the next step, locked to the master clock.

Source: `upstream/` is Zac Kyoti's repository (Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw,
submodule, pinned to `329b801`). The declaration is
`upstream/octabam-modules/direct-jump-kyoti/manifest.py`: one DRAM unit (`patch_directjump_v7.s`) on the pattern landing, the [PTN] release and the [PTN]-layer YES record, each re-linked and
compared with the author's own bytes (`reference`) every build. Its source
paths are derived from its own directory, so it is executed here from the
source on disk, as the registry does for every manifest, and this file only
re-exports its MODULE. Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here.

On hardware: the author's MKI, 27-28 Sep 2026 (standalone 140C_KDJ7 and the KYOTI V1.0 combined image), and 1 Oct 2026 from DRAM in an octabam image with all six KYOTI modules; Program Change re-cues, MIDI tracks, START SILENT and the trig-condition reset emulator-verified.
