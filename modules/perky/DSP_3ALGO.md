# Composed reduced Perky DSP machine — implementation record

**Branch:** `perky-dsp-2voice-3algo` (from `perky-optimize`, commit `a522d2f2`).

This is the reduced production target: **two Perky voices total, one per DSP
core, three selectable algorithms each.** It is deliberately smaller than the
superseded twelve-family / four-voice target and it does **not** move synthesis
back to ColdFire.

## Final architecture

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Capable tracks | Octatrack **T1** and **T5** only |
| Core mapping | T1 on payload **B** (its core carries T1–T4); T5 on payload **A** (T5–T8) |
| Voices per core | exactly **one** |
| Algorithms | **Fold Drum 1**, **Resonant Bass**, **Resonant Snare** |
| T2–T4, T6–T8 | ordinary Octatrack tracks |
| FX1 + FX2 | preserved on all eight tracks |
| Wavetable | not used |

The three algorithms reuse the already-qualified renderers. Nothing was
rewritten: `build_dsp_3algo_source.py` composes the *same* bodies the
standalone gates execute, and every state/trigger/mode behaviour is theirs.

## Composition and deduplication

`tools/perky/build_dsp_3algo_source.py` emits one source for both payloads.
Its `measure()` reports the real linked size, never the sum of standalone
probes.

| | P words |
| --- | ---: |
| Fold Drum 1 standalone probe | 1,337 |
| Resonant Bass standalone probe | 2,456 |
| Resonant Snare standalone probe | 2,338 |
| Naive sum | 6,131 |
| **Composed shipping source** | **4,000** |

The 2,131-word difference is measured, not estimated. Deduplication is
*proved*, not assumed:

* the bass and snare resonator/decay cores must canonicalise to
  byte-identical instruction text or the build stops;
* the exact `pk_u32_*` low32 arithmetic, the RNG/noise stream, the hardware
  noise sample-and-hold helper and the shared envelope renderer
  (`pk_noise_hat_envelope`) are emitted once;
* the standalone math dispatcher (`pk_math_probe`), which shipping code never
  calls, is dropped from the resonant tail;
* the Fold/Simple primitive set (`pk_simple_envelope` / `_frequency` /
  `_oscillator` / `_delta_at` / `_base`) is emitted once.

`resonant_dsp.source()` gained a keyword-only `core_variables_fixed` hook so
two families can share one decoder body; with its defaults it reproduces the
standalone probe byte-for-byte, which is why the existing gates still pass.

### How the cores were made shareable

The decoder cores address their temporaries through `r4`. Bass and snare
reached the generator with different variable counts, so the same instruction
sequence carried different displacements. `core_variables_fixed` pins the
twelve temporaries plus `r_input` to a private slot block and moves each
family's own variables above it. A canonical-label comparison then shows the
two bodies are the same machine code, and one copy ships.

## Private X ledger (per core)

| Range | Words | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `X:$3800..$386b` | 108 | the one voice object (largest algorithm is the 101-word snare) |
| `X:$386c..$38e7` | 124 | spare |
| `X:$38e8..$38eb` | 4 | shared RNG stream (two u32 limbs) |
| `X:$38ec` | 1 | source-seam event offset |
| `X:$38ed` | 1 | one-Perky-track-per-core admission latch |
| `X:$3900..$39bb` | 188 | shared render scratch (resonant needs 184) |

The RNG limbs are a **fixed absolute address** owned by the shared helper, not
a register-relative slot. The composer refuses to build if the helper moves
them, because every renderer would silently read a different stream.

## Y ledger

The Fold/Simple bodies carry their table bases as absolute immediates, so
their addresses are fixed by the qualified renderer and the ledger fits around
them:

| Base | Words | Content |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Y:$07a5` | 512 | three 256-point Fold/Simple waves |
| `Y:$0c50` | 683 | shape-0 amplitude curve |
| `Y:$0efb` | 68 | packed pitch basis (+padding) |
| `Y:$2000` / `Y:$2280` | 683 / 683 | resonant curve banks 1 and 2 |
| `Y:$2500` / `Y:$2600` | 257 / 257 | resonant interpolation tables A and B |

Total ≈ 3,320 words of the 2,139-word *private* low-Y budget plus the resonant
tables; placement of the resonant banks is the next measurement (see below).

## Status this round

**Done and verified**

* the composed source builds; `4000` P words measured with `dsp_asm` at
  `P:$1000`;
* each retained standalone renderer gate still passes unchanged
  (`verify_perky_fold_drum_exec.py`, `verify_perky_resonant_dsp_exec.py`);
* the deduplication identities are enforced by the builder itself;
* the RNG base and the Fold/Simple table bases are asserted, not assumed.

**Open — the composed execution gate, and the scratch-convention item**

Two things are open, and the first is a real implementation item rather than a
harness problem.

**(1) The scratch convention is not unified — fully characterized.**

The composed machine hands every algorithm the same scratch base, but its
pieces were written against two different conventions. Measured displacement
windows (against each body's own base):

| Body | Window | Native convention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fold_drum_voice.asm` | `0x5d .. 0x61` | uncentred (`r5+$n`) |
| `simple_drum_delta.asm` | `0x48 .. 0x60` | uncentred |
| `pknv_noise` (noise helper) | `0x00 .. 0x61` | uncentred |
| `noise_tone_math.asm` (shared low32/RNG) | `-0x40 .. +0x02` | CENTRED |
| resonant voice | `-0x40 .. +0x3e` | CENTRED |
| resonant cores | `-0x40 .. +0x3a` | CENTRED |

Two additional hard facts:

* every body's window fits inside the DSP's one-word `-64..63` displacement
  range only under its own convention, so a single scratch block cannot host
  a mixed set;
* `pk_simple_base` names its second-difference cache by **absolute** address
  (the literal `$3964`, with `r4` fixed there) rather than relative to the
  caller's base, and `pk_simple_delta_at` shares that cache.

**The intended fix** (worked out but not yet landed; it needs one more
measurement round because the two obvious variants both silently rendered
zero):

1. put the Fold/Simple bodies and `pknv_noise` on the centred convention by
   advancing `r5` by `0x40` at each entry label and subtracting `0x40` from
   every displacement (this is exactly what
   `dsp_source_layout.center_scratch` does for the resonant recipes);
2. set the composed `SCRATCH_BASE` so the *centred* ABI lands at `0x3940`;
   the Fold primitives then read their own documented field map
   (`0x3940..0x39a2`) and their absolute cache at `0x3964` with no relocation;
3. relocate the single absolute `#>$003964` literal at compose time to
   `#>$0039a4` if the centred ABI is instead kept at `0x3940` while the
   scratch block starts at `0x38c0` — whichever of (2)/(3) the next
   measurement shows is consistent.

The point of recording this is that the numbers, not the approach, were the
missing piece: the composed scratch block is 188 words, the private X region
below it is `0x3800..0x38e7`, and the whole question is where the 128-word
`-64..63` window can sit so that all six bodies and the absolute cache fall
inside it. Step 1 plus a `SCRATCH_BASE` of `0x38c0` is the candidate that
satisfies every window simultaneously and is the next thing to build.

### The equivalence gate

`tools/verify/verify_perky_3algo_equivalence.py` is the gate that now carries
the bit-exactness claim. It assembles the shipping composition and each
standalone renderer program, disassembles both, and requires **every renderer
instruction to be identical** apart from the operands that necessarily move when
code relocates: the absolute target of a `DO`, `JSR`/`JSRL` or branch. Every
other operand -- accumulators, registers, displacements, immediates, parallel
moves -- must match word for word, so an accidental change to a shift, a guard,
a table base or a slot fails the build.

It caught a real defect on its first run: the composer emitted the shared
low32/RNG/envelope helper block **twice** -- once centred (carried by the
resonant tail) and once uncentred (re-read raw from `noise_tone_math.asm` by
`extra_body`). The uncentred copy won, so the composed `pk_rng_step` read
`x:(r5+$0)` where the qualified build reads `x:(r5-$40)`: a different scratch
word, silently. The composer now keeps the centred tail whole (dropping only
the standalone `pk_math_probe` dispatcher) and `extra_body` supplies only the
noise sample-and-hold helper the tail lacks, with an assertion that the tail
really does own it.

### Measured result

| | P words |
| --- | ---: |
| Fold Drum 1 standalone | 1,312 |
| Resonant Bass standalone | 2,447 |
| Resonant Snare standalone | 2,329 |
| Naive standalone sum | 6,088 |
| **Composed shipping source** | **3,936** |
| Deduplicated | **2,152** |

Fold Drum 1, Resonant Bass and Resonant Snare all pass the equivalence gate.

The standalone per-renderer gates stay green, so per-renderer qualification is
unaffected: `verify_perky_fold_drum_exec.py` and
`verify_perky_resonant_dsp_exec.py` both pass unchanged.
