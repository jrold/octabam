"""SIDECHAIN_COMPRESSOR -- stock COMPRESSOR with a side-chain KEY from any track: KEY, KFLT, KGN and MON on page 2.

Source: `upstream/` is Zac Kyoti's repository (Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw,
submodule, pinned to `329b801`). The declaration is
`upstream/octabam-modules/sidechain-compressor/manifest.py`: one ROM unit
(`patch_sidechain.s`), re-linked and compared with the author's own bytes
(`reference`) every build, and a DSP section reached only from three hooks
(`MenuEntry.stock_dsp`: the effect is stock COMPRESSOR). Its source paths are
derived from its own directory, so it is executed here from the source on disk,
as the registry does for every manifest, and this file only re-exports its
MODULE. Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here.
