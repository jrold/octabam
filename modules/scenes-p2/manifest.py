"""SCENES P2 -- scene locks and the crossfader reach page 2 of FX1 and FX2.

Stock morphs 30 bytes a track a scene: page 1 of the five pages. Page 2 has
no scene byte, and the exclusion is structural (block size, the 32-pair
working copy, the frame builder's loop extents; docs/firmware/MIDI.md
Appendix C). This module keeps its page-2 locks in bytes 30 and 31 of
each track's block in the stock scene block, which the frame builder skips
(eight two-byte cells a scene), and adds one pass to the frame builder, after the stock morph and before
the transfer, that lerps every locked page-2 slot into the voice record
with the stock weight table; a select snaps at the fader's midpoint. A
page-2 knob turned while a scene is held edits that scene's lock instead
of the Part (both page-2 editors detoured at entry). The cells travel with
the scene: Part Save / Reload, Project Save and a KITS Kit copy the Part
whole, and stock scene copy, paste, undo and clear copy each track's 32
bytes.

Sites: the frame builder's join after the morph (0x4000cf40), the FX2
page-2 editor (0x4003a9dc) and FX1's (0x4003abe4), all at instruction
boundaries with the displaced instructions replayed.
