"""Can this machine build a remix at all? -- the every-remix sweeps' skip list.

`make verify` builds every remix (tools/verify/verify_replaces.py), and two
kinds of module cannot build on every machine for reasons that have nothing
to do with octabam's code:

  * a module whose sources are a git SUBMODULE that is not checked out
    (a clone made without `git submodule update --init --recursive`); and
  * a module whose linked unit is checked against its AUTHOR'S bytes
    (Linked.reference -- USB MIDI). Those bytes come from the author's
    BARE-METAL m68k-elf toolchain. With Ubuntu's m68k-linux-gnu toolchain,
    symlinked to the m68k-elf names, USB MIDI's unit links to 1,130 bytes
    that are not its author's and the build refuses every remix that
    carries it (27 Sep 2026), so that toolchain is treated as absent.

A third reason, Octakit's appended runtime (schema.Runtime), went with
Octakit on 6 Oct 2026.

`unbuildable(name)` names the reason, or returns None. It is for SWEEPS only:
a remix the caller named explicitly is always built, so `make bus REMIX=kits`
still fails loudly on a machine that cannot build it. A skip is never silent
-- every caller prints the remix and the reason.
