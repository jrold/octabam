"""The stock FX2 effects, as things a remix can keep in the chooser.

Every octabam image replaces the FX2 chooser wholesale with the remix's
modules. Only three stock effects are consumed -- PLATE, SPRING and DARK
REV, whose 2,724 words of DSP code are the donor region modules pack into;
the other eleven keep their code, descriptor and dispatch entries in every
image. This table lets a remix list them by name, in chooser order, beside
the modules. A stock entry costs nothing: no clone, no placement, no words,
no cycles charged by `make cycles` (FILTER's 192 cycles is the only figure
measured, docs/firmware/CHIP.md); the build writes its list row and cursor
position.

Its knobs are read from the stock descriptor, not declared: names, defaults,
value counts and the enable bitmap come out of the pristine image
(out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin), so the remixer shows a stock effect's real
controls and `send_probe --set` can drive them by name. When the image is
absent the entry carries no params.

A select's labels come from the firmware: the words a stock select draws
("12dB|24dB", "NONE|HP|LP|BOTH") are printed by the slot's display-formatter
function, so tools/build/stock_labels.py runs each formatter on the emulated
ColdFire for every value and checks the result in as stock_labels.json. The
selftest proves it still matches whenever the emulator is available.

Rendering: a stock effect renders locally the way an insert does, dsp_host
running its code from a dump of the stock image's payload A
(tools/remix/audition.py) with `-alloc 1`, so an effect that takes an
instance buffer gets Y:0x4000 as the hardware gives track 1. DELAY cannot
render: its DSP dispatch is stock's null stub; the Echo Freeze delay runs
on the ColdFire (DMA over SDRAM rings, docs/firmware/COLDFIRE_DELAY.md).

  DELAY (0x08)   works from its row as on a stock unit, costs the DSP
                 nothing, no local render.
  SPATIALIZER, FLANGER, CHORUS, COMB allocate an FX2 instance buffer through
                 the host's bump allocator (X:0x213 at init;
                 docs/firmware/DSP.md section 10) at per-track bases that
                 are the addresses BusVerb and BusDelay hardcode.
                 The ledger refuses them beside any module with fixed Y
                 buffers (Claims.stock_instance_buffer).

Addresses are the descriptors' E addresses from docs/firmware/PARAM_PAGES.md
section 2 (P = E + 0x38 is what the chooser list holds). Words are the
module spans from docs/firmware/DSP.md section 7c, for the index only.

# exclusive. ⚠️ STATIC SCAN, NOT A READ-WATCH: a record is attributed by
# the P words whose value falls inside it, so a reader that reaches it by
# indexing past another record, or through a pointer held in data, is
# invisible. A record no P word addresses belongs to nobody and is not
