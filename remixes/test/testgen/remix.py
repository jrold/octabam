"""TESTGEN on FX1 beside the stock effects: PLATE REV gives up its words for TESTGEN's code.

A test source belongs at the head of a track's chain, so TESTGEN takes an FX1
row (it is buffer-free) and no FX2 row (Claims.fx1_only, so the registry hides
it from FX2); FX1 keeps all ten of its stock effects and FX2 its stock list. A
project saved with TESTGEN on FX2 (0.1) passes that track's audio through
untouched. Two TESTGENs in series on one track crackled on Ignorato's MKII (FX1
PINK into FX2 TESTGEN, OCTABAM10, 4 Oct 2026; cause not found)."""
